# USC-103-OOP-HW
A collection of all the homework assignments I have completed at USC in CSCI-103 Object Oriented Programming

Primes23: Goal is to write a program that determines if a natural number has ONLY 2 and/or 3 as prime factors and how many of each it has
Abundant: Goal is to write a program that identifies the top 3 most "abundant" numbers from a set. Arrays and pointers were NOT allowed in this assignment. An "abundant" number is one where the sum of its divisors is greater than the number itself
